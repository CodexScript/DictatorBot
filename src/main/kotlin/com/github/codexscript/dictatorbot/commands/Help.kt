            |__Social Credit System__
            |The CCP has put in place a system to better evaluate the trustworthiness of citizens! It works like this:
            |> - Every citizen starts with a credit score of 1000
            |> - Your behavior is evaluated using numerous factors, which can impact your score positively or negatively
            |> - Your score is used to determine your social credit tier, which in turn determines your rights and privileges within the system
            |Use `/socialcredit` to see your current score and tier
            |Use `/tiers` to see the different tiers and their score ranges
            |
